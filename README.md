# atimzhao.github.io

This website is a git repo and uses GitHub Pages to host. I switched a custom domain of www.atimzhao.com from AWs
to Google Cloud (your paying money for this). If I didn't have a custom domain, Git's default is atimzhao.github.io
When you make edits here and then push to origin, it should update the website automatically.

Everything starts from index.html. This is the file (and file name) GitHub Pages looks for and shows to the user. Use npm to install necessary extra stuff like jquery, font-awesome, bootstrap which can be found in the vendor folder. You should be able to edit the website content without actually knowing whats happening. If you replace images, make sure the address in the code is still correct. Used npm to install stuff like bootstrap, font-awesome, jquery which can be found in the vendor folder but I don't actually use node.
